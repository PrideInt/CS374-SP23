## Currency Conversion, Euros to USD (#3)

This app, programmed for my midterm for CS374 of the Spring 2023 semester converts
euro currency to USD currency. I have done this with a simple, elegant UI that provides an input
box where you are able to input the amount in euros, and by clicking the convert Button, you are
able to display the converted amount in USD.

### Design process

I designed this app without much complexity, though its elements having been refined to show elegance 
in the app when I began to develop the app on Android Studio's layout. Though the constraints
were tediously annoying, to respect both portrait and landscape mode.
